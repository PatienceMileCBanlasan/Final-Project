      <p>When people of different gender identities, as well as men and women, have unequal access to opportunities, resources, and rights, it is referred to as gender inequality. The underlying social norms and power structures that support discrimination and the unequal allocation of privileges and power are the cause of this discrepancy. Addressing gender inequality is essential to achieving social justice and equality because it makes the problems already experienced by those who are marginalized worse. </p>

    <div class="descrip2">
      <p>Gender inequality has existed throughout human history, shaped by social, cultural, religious, and economic factors. In ancient societies, roles were often strictly defined by gender, with men typically holding power and authority, while women were assigned domestic and subordinate roles. This pattern persisted through the medieval and early modern periods, where women had limited access to education, property, and legal rights. The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries saw some shifts, as women began working in factories, though they were paid less and faced harsh conditions. Meanwhile, the rise of the women's suffrage movement in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the West led to significant milestones, such as women gaining the right to vote. In the mid-20th century, the feminist movements of the 1960s and 1970s pushed for gender equality in areas like the workplace, education, and reproductive rights. Despite these advances, women (and gender minorities) continue to face challenges such as unequal pay, gender-based violence, and underrepresentation in leadership roles. In recent years, conversations around gender inequality have expanded to include LGBTQ+ rights, challenging traditional gender norms and advocating for a more inclusive understanding of gender beyond the binary. Progress has been made, but full equality remains a global and ongoing struggle.</p>
